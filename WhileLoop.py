# This portion will contain code regarding
# the while and for loops
# I will be doing individual codes for each of the tutorials from now on. 

# While loop, what is it? 
# Mostly used as a form of counter, there to count something
# Condition = variable in this case


Condition = 1
while Condition < 10: 
  print(Condition)
  Condition += 1
  # The above is read as Condition = Condition + 1
while True:
  print('This number is less than 10')

# The above code is setting a variable, condition in this case, 
# Condition will always be less than 1. Thus, the output should output the numbers 1-9 but not 10. 
# While the above is true, the output "This number is less than 10" will appear.
