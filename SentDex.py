#   Writing things for each SentDex tutorial I've undergone: 
#   Int functions only with integers (Whole number) ways to bypass this is by using Float
#   Example: Print(Int(8+3.3)) will print only 11 
#            However, print(float(8+3.3)) will print 11.3
#   Text inside of single or double quotes makes the content inside it a string
#   If an apostrophe is needed in a string, adding a backslash before it will not cause any problems
#   Example: Print('We\'re going to have a great time learning python.)
#   Concatenating brings things, (strings, links, folders, etc) together in a chain or series
#   
# 
# 
# 
# 
#   Mathematical expressions
#   +, -, *, /, ** (to the power of)  


print('This is me taking python seriously')
print('So.. In order to concatenate, a comma is needed?')
print('How bout a high 5?')
print(int(8+3.3))



# this is a trial
# 5/68: Variables
# Used very frequently, perhaps in almost every code written
# Examples of syntax: exampleVar - "Camel Casing"
#           example_var
#           EXAMPLE_VAR 
# Doesn't matter, camel casing is optimal. 
# Examples of variables: exampleVar = 66
#                        Print(exampleVar) will output 66
# Can also be an equation EX: 66+32 = 98
# Can also be a function
# EX: exampleVar = print('Oh wow!')
# Typing exampleVar will output 'Oh wow!' 
# Unpacking a variable 
# EX: x,y = (3,5)
#     print(x) = 3
#     print(y) = 5


exampleVar = print('oh wow!')
exampleVar

exampleVarr = 66
print(exampleVarr)

exampleVarrr = 66+32
print(exampleVarrr)

x,y = (3,5)
print(x)
print(y)
