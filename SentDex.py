#   I just want to write something to look back at for each lesson.  
#   Int function works with whole numbers only EX: Print(int(8+3.3)) will output 11 only. 
#   Print(float(8+3.3)) , however, will output the correct amount of 11.3 
#   Incasing anything in single or double quotes makes the content inside a string. 
#   we\'re going to use a \ whenever '' is used. Concatentation happens 
#   when two strings are added to one another. example: Hi + there will result in
#   hithere.


print('This is me taking python seriously')
print('So.. In order to concatenate, a comma is needed?')
print('How bout a high 5?')
print(int(8+3.3))
