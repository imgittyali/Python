#   Writing things for each SentDex tutorial I've undergone: 
#   Int functions only with integers (Whole number) ways to bypass this is by using Float
#   Example: Print(Int(8+3.3)) will print only 11 
#            However, print(float(8+3.3)) will print 11.3
#   Text inside of single or double quotes makes the content inside it a string
#   If an apostrophe is needed in a string, adding a backslash before it will not cause any problems
#   Example: Print('We\'re going to have a great time learning python.)
#   Concatenating brings things, (strings, links, folders, etc) together in a chain or series
#   
# 
# 
# 
# 
#   Mathematical expressions
#   +, -, *, /, ** (to the power of)  


print('This is me taking python seriously')
print('So.. In order to concatenate, a comma is needed?')
print('How bout a high 5?')
print(int(8+3.3))
